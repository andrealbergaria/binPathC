    		   		        		   		Sums  are finite, so they represent one number. There are however subtration that have infinite representation of a number
        		   		        		   				
        		   		        		   
        		   		        		   A sum can be represented as a subtraction
        		   		        		   1 3
        		   		        		   A+B = infinite negative numbers  ==> (8-4,6-2)
