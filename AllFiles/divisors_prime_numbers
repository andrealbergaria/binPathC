1 × 6 = 6, so 1 and 6 are factors of 6
1 × 6 = 6, so 6 is a multiple of 6
2 × 6 = 12, so 12 is a multiple of 6


If prime number only has exactly two divisors, how can it be divisor of other number?

  
  prime number = divisor of itself  or 1.


The divisors of a natural number n are the natural numbers that divide n evenly.



has two divisors, 
is a divisor

is a divisor (m) = n/m 
two divisors (m) = m/p , m/p1  
divisors of (n) = m

======
Se m (prime number) so divide estes (p e p1)  , nao pode dividir os outros (n)

=======
If m (prime number) divides for example p, and p1, then it can't divide others, since its prime.
=========
 

difference between having one divisor, and being a divisor


If q divide's m and m divides n, then by transitive, n / q

 
 prime number only divides 2 numbers. How come it divides other numbers?
